This is Zinc15 database with ligands MW up to 250Da, with a logP range of 2-4.5
I can than take those and run the database threw Lipinski and Ghose)
              -These have been filtered for purchasing availability.


### The following ligands had less than 100 ligands from this search:
		group:               			number of ligands found
		aminobenzenethiol.smi:   		65
		benzil_or_benzoin.smi:   		85
		isocyanate.smi:   			1
		isothiocyanate.smi:   			1
		primary_or_secondary_halide.smi:  	21

The functional groups which were not present (had less than 100 molecules) were then filled in using:
	Zinc15 database with ligands MW up to 250Da, with a logP range of 2-4.5
	I can than take those and run the database threw Lipinski and Ghose)
	      	-These have been filtered for Any availability.
		Retrieved on /7/10/18
	- The resulting ligands were pooled for both ZINC15 database searches and redundancies were removed.

		aminobenzenethiol.smi:   		119
		benzil_or_benzoin.smi:   		87
		isothiocyanate.smi:			1
		isocyanate.smi:    			1
		primary_or_secondary_halide.smi:	32

		-This provided ligand sets for: aminobenzenethiol.smi (119 ligands) and benzil_or_benzoin (85 ligands)

Ligands from Autogrow 3.1.1's fragment library were converted from PDB's to 1D canonical SMILES, compiled into a single .smi file store in folder from_autogrow311.
These ligands were any ligand less than 250Da from autogrows fragment library.
	- Redundancies were removed and all SMILES were confirmed to work in rdkit.

-These were then sorted by functional groups.

We used these to fill in the following functional groups, by combining with the ligands found in the above description...

		benzil_or_benzoin.smi:   		87
		isothiocyanate.smi:			1267
		isocyanate.smi:    			1590
		primary_or_secondary_halide.smi:	1191

These were then filtered to ensure that they worked in every reaction which calls that functional group,
	-ie ) if a reaction is primary_or_secondary_halide + benzil_or_benzoin -> product
		- we ran 1191 reactions with primary_or_secondary_halide as the variable and the same benzil_or_benzoin as a control
			and we ran 87 reactions with the primary_or_secondary_halide as the control and benzil_or_benzoin as the variable.

	 
These resulted in 14 ligand populations exceeding 100,000 ligands:
['5_mem_aryl_w_NH_max2N', 'alcohol', 'aldehyde_or_ketone', 'alkyl_halogen_or_alcohol', 'amide', 'aryl_halide', 'carboxylic_acid', 'carboxylic_acid_or_ester', 'halide', 'hydrazine', 'ketone', 'nitrile', 'phenole', 'primary_amine', 'pyridine_pyrimidine_triazine', 'terminal_alkyne']

These libraries were trimmed down to 50,000 ligands for efficiency. They were randomly shuffled 5 times prior to selecting the 50k thus no intrinsic bias to their selection.

	We eliminated any ligands which failed this. We than ran the ligands threw all of the filters in that are offered by in Autogrow 4 (Ghose, Lipinski_Strict, Lipinski_Lenient, Mozziconacci, VandeWaterbeemd, PAINS_Filter, BRENK_Filter, NIH_Filter)

	- For several groups it these filters were too strict and eliminated all the ligands, filters such as the BRENK and NIH filter eliminated structural groups which were unstable even though those are required, or contains atleast 1 Oxygen was eliminated when it removed all ligands from the populations.
