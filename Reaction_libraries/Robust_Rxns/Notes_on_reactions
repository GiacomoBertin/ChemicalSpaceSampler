Many small modifications have been the reactions in this set which are derived from .

Small changes which were made include:
    - Adjusting some SMARTs to be more inclusive, when chemically acceptable.
    - Canonicalizing functional groups so that all reactions which use a functional group
        able to use the same functional group complimentary_mol library
        - ie. 6 reactions require a general alkyne, but originally used multiple versions of
            same SMART even though there was no limiting factor that differed between them.
            So we made adapted those reactions to use the canonical smart parttern.



Major Changes

1) Reaction #48 48_sulfon_amide:
    sulfonyl chloride is a reactant described in the original reaction, but sulfonyl chloride
        is an unstable intermediate which is unlikely to be commercially available. 
        Normally the reaction described would begin with a sulfonic acid with an R-group, which is
        converted to sulfonyl chloride before the reaction.
            - please see https://www.organic-chemistry.org/synthesis/N1S/sulfonamides.shtm  or
            - An easy and handy synthesis of sulfonamides directly from sulfonic acids or its sodium salts is performed under microwave irradiation, has shown a good functional group tolerance, and is high yielding.
                L. De Luca, G. Giacomelli, J. Org. Chem., 2008, 73, 3967-3969.
    Because sulfonic acids are commercially available and make sense for the purpose of Autogrow,
        we chose to instead reduce this 2 step reaction to a simplified 1 step reaction
        Which starts with the sulfonic acids and directly react it with an amine. This of course would
        the intermediate generation of sulfonyl chloride in a wet lab setting.
    We modified the reaction and description accordingly.
